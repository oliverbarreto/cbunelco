// Central CSS File to compile
// // This is the new “central” file that you’ll compile to CSS. Along with the original LESS files, it imports the two custom files above using the following commands:
// --------------------------------------------------

// This is the central file. It imports all of the others and is the one you’ll ultimately compile.
@import "../bootstrapLessV3.0.3/less/bootstrap.less";

// I make a copy of variables.less from Bootstrap’s source and modify the variables in this copy instead.
@import "customVariables.less";

// This file holds any other customizations that I want to make that aren’t possible with the variables.
@import "customCSS.less";

// This is always the last file to be imported, in order for the classes that it contains to override the rest of the styles where necessary.
@import "../bootstrapLessV3.0.3/less/utilities.less";
